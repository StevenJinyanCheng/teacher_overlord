# Moral Education Platform - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
The Moral Education Platform is a comprehensive web application designed to track and manage student behavior based on moral education rules. The system supports multiple user roles (Student, Parent, Teaching Teacher, Class Teacher, Moral Education Supervisor, Principal, Director, System Administrator) with role-based permissions and features.

## Implementation Status
